  email : blah@email.test
  github : username
  twitter : username
  feedburner : feedname

# The production_url is only used when full-domain names are needed
# such as sitemap.txt 
# Most places will/should use BASE_PATH to make the urls
#
# If you have set a CNAME (pages.github.com) set your custom domain here.
# Else if you are pushing to username.github.com, replace with your username.
# Finally if you are pushing to a GitHub project page, include the project name at the end.
#
production_url : http://username.github.com

# All Jekyll-Bootstrap specific configurations are namespaced into this hash
#
JB :
  version : 0.1.0

  # All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
  # This is required for hosting GitHub Project Pages.
  # If you are deploying this website for one of your GitHub projects
  # you must set BASE_PATH to the name of your GitHub project.
  #
  # Leave this blank if you have defined a CNAME for your site (pages.github.com)
  # NOTE: When in localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
  #
  BASE_PATH : ""

  # By default, the asset_path is automatically defined relative to BASE_PATH plus the enabled theme.
  # ex: [BASE_PATH]/assets/themes/[THEME-NAME]
  #
  # Override this by defining an absolute path to assets here.
  # ex: 
  #   http://s3.amazonaws.com/yoursite/themes/watermelon
  #   /assets
  #
  ASSET_PATH : false

  # These paths are to the main pages Jekyll-Bootstrap ships with.
  # Some JB helpers refer to these paths; change theme here if needed.

  archive_path: /archive.html
  categories_path : /categories.html
  tags_path : /tags.html

  # Settings for comments helper
  # Set 'provider' to the comment provider you want to use.

  # Settings for sharing helper. 
  # Sharing is for things like tweet, plusone, like, reddit buttons etc.
  # Set 'provider' to the sharing provider you want to use.
  # Set 'provider' to false to turn sharing off globally.
  #
  sharing :
    provider : false
    
  # Settings for all other include helpers can be defined by creating 
  # a hash with key named for the given helper. ex:
  #
  #   pages_list :
  #     provider : "custom"   
  #
  # Setting any helper's provider to 'custom' will bypass the helper code
  # and include your custom code. Your custom file must be defined at:
  #   ./_includes/custom/[HELPER]
  # where [HELPER] is the name of the helper you are overriding.
